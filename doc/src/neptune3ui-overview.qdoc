   \title Neptune 3 UI - Overview
   \brief Overview of Neptune 3 User Interface

   The Qt Automotive Suite includes Neptune 3 UI, which is a reference UI
   implementation for Qt in In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) systems.

   Neptune 3 UI aims to:

   \list
   \li Provide best practices for how to develop an automotive UI using
       \l{Qt Automotive Suite}.
   \li Get UI designers and software developers to collaborate efficiently.
   \li Provide UI designers with methods to control the look-and-feel.
   \li Improve flexibility by enabling
       \l{Qt Automotive Suite Product} {Qt Automotive Suite} to integrate with
       external tools, such as 3D tools, Maps, Qt IVI, and more.
   \li Provide a multi-process UI that forms a base for an IVI system.
   \endlist

   \section1 Features

   Neptune 3 UI contains the following key features:

   \list
   \li Implemented with with Qt/QML, based on \l{Qt Application Manager} that
       takes care of the application and window management.
   \li Can be integrated with various car 3D model technologies.
   \li Can be integrated with various navigation solutions.
   \li Utilizes the \l{Qt IVI} module, that provides C++ classes and QML types
       to access vehicle features, as well as a core API to implement new IVI
       features.
   \endlist

   \section1 Neptune 3 UI Apps

   Neptune 3 UI contains several built-in (pre-installed) apps:

   \table
   \header
       \li Neptune 3 Apps
       \li Description
   \row
       \li Vehicle App (\c vehicleapp)
       \li Shows a 3D visualization of the car with its common settings and

           destination, show the current location, and show the direction to
           home or work from the current location. The Maps app can also be
           viewed offline.
   \row

       \li An organizer app with some dummy data showing a set of
           appointments, the current year calendar and dummy weather forecast
           with mockup data. Currently, there is no real backend implemented.
           for this app.
   \row
       \li Phone App (\c phoneapp)
       \li A Phone app with a dummy contact list, that can be simulated.
           Currently, there is no real backend implemented for this app.
   \row
       \li Tuner App (\c tunerapp)

           simulation backend from \l{Qt IVI}.
   \row
       \li Downloads App (\c downloadsapp)
       \li Allows the user to install apps from the Neptune Deployment Store
           to Neptune 3 UI. There are a few apps available, such as Spotify,
           Netflix, Web Radio App, and Same Game. Users can also uninstall
           these external apps using the Downloads app.
   \row

           as color settings.
   \endtable

   \section1 Visual Concept

   The Neptune 3 UI visual concept includes different UI elements:

   \list
    \li \l{Instrument Cluster}
    \li \l{Center Console Display}
    \li \l{App Launcher}
    \li \l{App Widget}
    \li \l{Climate Bar}
    \li \l{Notification Center}
   \endlist

   \section2 Instrument Cluster

   \image instrument-cluster.jpg

   The Instrument Cluster displays driving related information such as speed,
   cruise control parameters, gear and energy use (for an electric car). Users
   can also have information from the selected app windows, such as Music or
   Maps, ordered in views which they can navigate between. To switch
   between the app windows available, the user can use Neptune 3 UI's remote
   settings server or press \e{CTRL + c} in a physical keyboard.

   \image instrument-cluster-nav.jpg

   The size and position of gauges and other driving related information are
   flexible to make space for views, like Maps that can take up more space
   (as shown above).

   \section2 Center Console Display

   The Center Console display shows the multi-process capabilities; the fact
   that we can run several apps simultaneously, with quick response and
   smooth transitions. Even if, technically, we have different apps that run on
   separate processes, the border between these apps is faded out. In turn, the
   border between these apps and the System UI is also faded out, giving the
   user an experience that this is one unified system.

   \image center-stack.jpg

   In addition to traditional apps, like Music, Phone, and Maps, the
   Center Console display also contains climate settings, system notifications,
   different vehicle information, and vehicle settings.

   Some apps, such as Music, can be displayed in fullscreen or as widgets.
   Widgets are apps that run in a smaller window and adapt their content to fit
   into a widget window. These widgets are used in the customizable home screen.

   When an app is maximized, it takes over the whole Center Console and shows
   the app's full content, as illustrated below.

   \image center-stack-maximized-app.jpg

   \section2 App Launcher

   Expand the App Launcher by tapping on the grid icon in the upper
   right corner of the screen.

   \image grid-icon.jpg

   Users can choose which app to maximize by tapping on the app icon. Users
   can also define four top apps to show without expanding the launcher by
   pressing and holding the selected app, and then dragging it to the desired
   position as illustrated in the following image:

   \image center-stack-app-launcher.jpg

   \section2 App Widget

   By default, the \l{Center Console Display} shows three app widgets. Users can
   choose which app to show on the home screen as a widget, by tapping on the
   Add Widget icon below the lowest widget and choose the desired app.

   \image center-stack-add-widget.jpg

   Only apps that have a widget option are listed there. The user can also remove
   a widget from the home screen by tapping on the X icon at the widget's
   bottom left corner.

   \note Removing an app widget does not mean that the app is terminated. The
   app might still be running in the background. See
   \l{Neptune 3 UI System Dialog} for more information about terminating an
   app.

   \section2 Climate Bar

   \image center-stack-climate.jpg

   The Climate Bar is located at the bottom of the \l{Center Console Display}.
   Tapping on it displays a climate panel with some simulation data interface
   to \l{Qt IVI} as shown in the following image:

   \section2 Notification Center

   \image center-stack-notification-center.jpg

   The Notification Center stores notifications that are triggered in
   Neptune 3 UI. When a notification is triggered, first, a notification toast
   message is shown, and then it is stored in the Notification Center. The user
   can remove individual notifications in the Notification Center, or clear the
   Notification Center completely.
