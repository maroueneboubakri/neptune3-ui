   \title Neptune 3 UI - Application Anatomy
   \brief Anatomy of the applications in Center Console Display

   In Neptune 3, an application can have both the full-screen state
   and the (optional) widget state. The states should not be designed
   separately since they need to be connected, if possible, with smooth
   transitions.

   \section1 Full-Screen

   When applications are in full-screen they typically have two main
   content areas: top and bottom. The top area is for the most important
   information, or information that is graphically complex. Try having the
   same content and layout in the top area in full-screen vs. in a widget
   (see more details in the widget section below). The bottom area is for
   more detailed information. In most cases the content is divided into
   different pages, navigated between with the tool bar to the left.

   Design the bottom content spacious and do not mix different kinds of content.
   If there are different kinds of content, please put them into different
   sections with sufficient space in between.

   \section2 Breaking the rules

   Not every application should look the same. The best explaining cases are
   probably Navigation and Camera apps since they include complex graphics.
   Both applications need to look different from the default one,
   but should give the same impression.

   Some applications might not need to display the ToolBar, neither the top area.
   Use a layout that fits the content of your application.

   \section1 Widget

   The widgets on the home screen can be resized into three sizes: 1-Row,
   2-Rows and 3-Rows. Try to minimize and simplify the content of the widgets;
   with up to five widgets on the home screen at the same time it tends to
   look cluttered. Create larger widgets with more features for adding extra
   value for the user.

   The widget content is generally designed along with the transitions between the three
   states and of course widget and full-screen visuals. The top in full-screen should normally
   look exactly like one of the widget sizes (1Row or 2Rows). The easiest way to
   design a nice transitions when switching between the sizes is to think of blocks
   ordered in a column, e.g. turn on/off blocks when the widget height changes.

   To make the widgets look good together there are some recommended alignment
   lines. Sometimes there are reasons not to use these lines, like in the
   example of the circular contact image for phone widget which fits better with
   the rectangular album art in the Music widget when it is slightly
   larger than the default size.
