   \title Neptune 3 UI - Application Popups

   An application popup is used from applications to display information inside modal popups.
   As these popups should be shown in the very top layer of the UI, the rendering should be
   done in \l{Neptune 3 UI - System UI}{System UI}. This approach involves \l{Qt Application Manager}
   and its ApplicationManagerWindow API.

   \section1 Implementation Insights

   The interface component to the application is \l{PopupWindow}. This is displayed
   in the \l{Center Console Display} and gives the application the flexibility to create
   popups containing any kind of custom content and display those in system ui as a
   modal popups. The Application Popup Store is responsible of holding all application popups in
   Neptune3 UI in a list and managing them. It is in other words a popup manager taking
   care of showing and dismissing popups. That said, it also takes care of the
   rendering taking into account all properties the application has set for this specific
   popup.

   See \l{PopupWindow} for detailed information and usage examples.
