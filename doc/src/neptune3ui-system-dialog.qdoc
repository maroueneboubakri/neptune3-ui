   \title Neptune 3 UI - System Dialog

   Neptune 3 UI has a system dialog where the user can see and monitor the performance
   of the system while running Neptune 3 UI. In order to pop the dialog up, user can
   tap on the Qt logo that is located at the bottom right corner of the UI.

   \section1 System Monitor

   The first tab of the system dialog contains the following information:

   \list
   \li Startup Timings: provides the time spent from booting until the process starting
       point of the System UI and from the starting point of the System UI until the first
       frame to be drawn
   \li CPU consumptions and memory consumptions
   \li Network (Internet Connection) Status
   \li Connected Network Devices with all their address information
   \li Version: shows which Neptune 3 UI, Application Manager and Qt IVI versions are being
       used
   \li Platform: shows which operating system, Qt version, and OpenGL are being used.
   \endlist

   On top of the list, there is also a switch button that is used to show the system monitor
   overlay on top of the UI to show the performance monitor numbers while operating the UI.

   \section1 List of Running Applications

   The second tab of the system dialog shows a list of current running applications in
   Neptune 3 UI. Each application item contains the following information:

   \list
   \li CPU and Memory consumptions
   \li Time spent until first frame of the application to be drawn
   \endlist

   Each application item also has a switch button to enable the performance overlay on top
   of the application window. For an application that has two windows, \l{ApplicationCCWindow} and
   \l{ApplicationICWindow}, two switch buttons can be seen and selected depending on the need.

   In order to kill the application, an X icon on the right side of the application item
   can be tapped. Once the application is killed, it will also be removed from the application
   list.

   \note Only removing the application widget in the home screen, does not mean that
   the application is killed, it could still be running in the background.

   \section1 Performance Tab

   The third tab of the system dialog contains two switch buttons to enable the performance
   overlay of the \l{center console display} and the \l{instrument cluster}. It forces the System UI
   to constantly re-draw itself to get the current GPU/CPU consumptions.

   \section1 Diagnostics Tab

   The last tab of the system dialog shows the output of the QtDiag diagnostic tool.
