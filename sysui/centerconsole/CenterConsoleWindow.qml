                By default, Neptune 3 consists of two windows, the center console window and the
                instrument cluster window. Below, the definition of the center console window content
                and the loading of the instrument cluster window is done. However on a device, the
                instrument cluster window will only be shown if there are two screens connected. There
                is also the possibility to configure whether it should be shown or not through the main
                yaml file, default is 'yes'.

                If additional windows shall be added, this can be done in the same way as the
                instrument cluster window is added in Neptune 3

                For more detail information, please visit Neptune 3 documentation page.
