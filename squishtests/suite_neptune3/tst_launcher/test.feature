Feature: The launcher bar is configurable

    The launcher bar is highly configurable.
    Sorted in a natural way the first items are
    visible.

    In the grid it is possible by drag and drop to
    move the items and change the order, and
    to launch apps directly


    Scenario: Open the launcher grid

        Given main menu is open
         And  the launcher bar is shown
         When the grid icon is tapped
         Then the grid should be 'opened'
         When the grid icon is tapped
         Then the grid should be 'closed'


    Scenario Outline: Launch an app from launcher grid

        Given main menu is open
         And  the launcher bar is shown
         When the grid icon is tapped
         Then the grid should be 'opened'
         When the launcher icon '<apps>' is tapped
         Then the grid should be 'closed'
          And after some '1' seconds
