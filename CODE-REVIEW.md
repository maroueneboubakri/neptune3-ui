When performing code reviews, it's the duty of reviewer to ensure the branch passes all tests before accepting it to be merged. The steps are the following:

## Ensure the qml tests pass

Simply run:
$ make check
And see that all tests have passed

## Perform some manual tests

All or most of the manual tests below should be automated (eg, made into qml tests). But while that doesn't happen, here they are.
